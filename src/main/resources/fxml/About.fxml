By contrast, the GNU General Public&#10;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free&#10;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This&#10;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#10;Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to&#10;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by&#10;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to&#10;your programs, too.&#10;&#10;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#10;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#10;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#10;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it&#10;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it&#10;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#10;&#10;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#10;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.&#10;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you&#10;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#10;&#10;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#10;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#10;you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#10;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their&#10;rights.&#10;&#10;  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and&#10;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,&#10;distribute and/or modify the software.&#10;&#10;  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain&#10;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free&#10;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we&#10;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so&#10;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original&#10;authors' reputations.&#10;&#10;  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#10;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free&#10;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the&#10;program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any&#10;patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.&#10;&#10;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#10;modification follow.&#10;&#10;                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#10;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#10;&#10;  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#10;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#10;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,&#10;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;&#10;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:&#10;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,&#10;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another&#10;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in&#10;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#10;&#10;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#10;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#10;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program&#10;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#10;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#10;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#10;&#10;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's&#10;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#10;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#10;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the&#10;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;&#10;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#10;along with the Program.&#10;&#10;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and&#10;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.&#10;&#10;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#10;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#10;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#10;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#10;&#10;    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#10;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#10;&#10;    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in&#10;    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#10;    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#10;    parties under the terms of this License.&#10;&#10;    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#10;    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#10;    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an&#10;    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#10;    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#10;    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#10;    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this&#10;    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#10;    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on&#10;    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#10;&#10;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#10;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#10;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#10;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#10;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#10;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#10;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#10;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#10;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.&#10;&#10;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#10;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#10;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#10;collective works based on the Program.&#10;&#10;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program&#10;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of&#10;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#10;the scope of this License.&#10;&#10;  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,&#10;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of&#10;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#10;&#10;    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#10;    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#10;    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,&#10;&#10;    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#10;    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#10;    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#10;    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#10;    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#10;    customarily used for software interchange; or,&#10;&#10;    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#10;    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#10;    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#10;    received the program in object code or executable form with such&#10;    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#10;&#10;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#10;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source&#10;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any&#10;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to&#10;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a&#10;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#10;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#10;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the&#10;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#10;itself accompanies the executable.&#10;&#10;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#10;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#10;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#10;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not&#10;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#10;&#10;  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#10;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#10;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is&#10;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.&#10;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under&#10;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such&#10;parties remain in full compliance.&#10;&#10;  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#10;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#10;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are&#10;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#10;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#10;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#10;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#10;the Program or works based on it.&#10;&#10;  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the&#10;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#10;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to&#10;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#10;restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.&#10;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to&#10;this License.&#10;&#10;  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#10;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#10;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#10;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#10;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#10;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#10;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#10;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#10;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by&#10;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#10;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#10;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#10;&#10;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under&#10;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to&#10;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#10;circumstances.&#10;&#10;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#10;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#10;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#10;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#10;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#10;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#10;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#10;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#10;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#10;impose that choice.&#10;&#10;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#10;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#10;&#10;  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in&#10;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#10;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#10;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#10;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among&#10;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#10;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#10;&#10;  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions&#10;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#10;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#10;address new problems or concerns.&#10;&#10;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program&#10;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any&#10;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions&#10;either of that version or of any later version published by the Free&#10;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of&#10;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software&#10;Foundation.&#10;&#10;  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free&#10;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author&#10;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free&#10;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes&#10;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals&#10;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and&#10;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#10;&#10;                            NO WARRANTY&#10;&#10;  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY&#10;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN&#10;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES&#10;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED&#10;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF&#10;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS&#10;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE&#10;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,&#10;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#10;&#10;  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#10;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR&#10;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,&#10;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING&#10;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED&#10;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY&#10;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER&#10;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE&#10;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#10;&#10;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#10;&#10;            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#10;&#10;  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#10;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it&#10;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.&#10;&#10;  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest&#10;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#10;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least&#10;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#10;&#10;    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#10;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#10;&#10;    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify&#10;    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by&#10;    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or&#10;    (at your option) any later version.&#10;&#10;    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#10;    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#10;    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#10;    GNU General Public License for more details.&#10;&#10;    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along&#10;    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,&#10;    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.&#10;&#10;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#10;&#10;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this&#10;when it starts in an interactive mode:&#10;&#10;    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author&#10;    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.&#10;    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it&#10;    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.&#10;&#10;The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate&#10;parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may&#10;be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be&#10;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#10;&#10;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your&#10;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if&#10;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#10;&#10;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program&#10;  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.&#10;&#10;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989&#10;  Ty Coon, President of Vice&#10;&#10;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into&#10;proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may&#10;consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the&#10;library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General&#10;Public License instead of this License." wrapText="true" />
